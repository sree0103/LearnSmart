LearnSmart: An E-Learning Application

**Project Name**: LearnSmart

**Technologies Used**: Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Thymeleaf

**Overview**:

LearnSmart is a basic E-Learning application designed to facilitate online learning through a user-friendly platform. This mini project is developed using Spring Boot for backend services, Spring MVC for handling web requests, and Thymeleaf for rendering dynamic HTML pages.

**Key Features**:

1. **User Registration**:
    - Users can register by providing their details, creating an account to access the application.
   
2. **User Login**:
    - Users can log in using their credentials to access their respective home pages (Admin or Learner).

3. **Home Pages**:
    - **Admin Home**: Dashboard for administrators to manage courses and lessons.
    - **Learner Home**: Dashboard for learners to access available courses and lessons.

4. **Admin Capabilities**:
    - **Create Courses**: Admins can create new courses, specifying course details such as name, description, category, and status.
    - **Update Courses**: Admins can update the details of existing courses.
    - **Delete Courses**: Admins can delete courses that are no longer needed.
    - **Add Lessons**: Admins can add new lessons to a course, providing content and resources for learners.
    - **Delete Lessons**: Admins can delete lessons from a course.

5. **Learner Capabilities**:
    - **View Courses**: Learners can browse through the list of available courses.
    - **View Lessons**: Learners can view lessons associated with a selected course, gaining access to learning materials and resources.

**Workflow**:

1. **Registration and Login**:
    - New users register on the platform and create an account.
    - Registered users log in to access their specific dashboard (Admin or Learner).

2. **Admin Workflow**:
    - Admins log in to access the admin dashboard.
    - Admins can create new courses by navigating to the 'Create Course' section.
    - Admins can view, update, or delete existing courses from the 'View Courses' section.
    - Within a course, admins can add or delete lessons to manage the course content.

3. **Learner Workflow**:
    - Learners log in to access the learner dashboard.
    - Learners can browse available courses in the 'View Courses' section.
    - Learners select a course to view the associated lessons, accessing educational content and resources.

**Implementation Details**:

- **Backend**:
    - Developed using Spring Boot, leveraging its features for rapid development and easy management.
    - Controllers handle HTTP requests and responses, providing endpoints for various functionalities (e.g., creating courses, viewing lessons).

- **Frontend**:
    - Thymeleaf templates render dynamic HTML pages, ensuring a responsive and interactive user interface.
    - Forms and data are dynamically populated based on user interactions and backend responses.

- **Security**:
    - Basic authentication implemented to manage user sessions and restrict access to certain functionalities based on user roles (Admin and Learner).

**Conclusion**:

LearnSmart serves as a foundational project for understanding the integration of Spring Boot, Spring MVC, and Thymeleaf in creating a functional web application. It demonstrates the basic functionalities required for an E-Learning platform, with role-based access control to differentiate between admin and learner capabilities. This project can be further expanded with more advanced features like user management, course enrollment, progress tracking, and interactive learning modules.
